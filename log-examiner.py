# Examine logs to see if there were exceptions.
# If found exceptions in logs, trigger test minimizer
# to produce a test case.

# Assumptions:
# 0. Already has DLJC deployed in the pre-defined relative location.
# 1. Corpus alredy downloaded.
# 2. Has knowledge about common corpus file structure.

# Inputs:
# - corpus location
# - corpus file location #TODO: how to combine this with corpus location?
# - list of projects need to be examined
# - log file pattern: a relative path to the log file in each project
# - error pattern: a regex string represents the interesting error in logs
# - tool executable: a driver script for running test minimizer with the configuration of the target tool.
#                    e.g. ontology/dataflow/etc.
#                    this tool executable should takes following input:
#                      $1: exception pattern $* build cmd
#                       e.g. tool_exec 'an exception regex pattern' build cmd

# Two modes:
# 1. Given a location of corpus, examine whole corpus.
# 2. Given a location of corpus, and a list of projects,
#    examine these projects in the corpus.

# TODO:
# 1. Extract common logic from corpus scripts. Build them as a python module.
# 2. Improve run-dljc.sh, maybe rewrite it in python, to be more flexible on receiving parameters.
